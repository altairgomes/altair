Abstract:
The prediction tables of stellar occultations by Eris, Haumea, Makemake, Quaoar,
Orcus, Sedna, Varuna, Ixion, 2002TX300 and 2003AZ84 for 2008-2015 were built to
support the investigation of the physical properties of large transneptunian
objects - keystones in the study of structure, origin and evolution of the Solar
System. Our goal was to derive precise, astrometric predictions. With this aim,
we constructed astrometric star catalogs in the UCAC2 system covering their sky
paths. For that, we have carried out in 2007-2009 an observational program at
the ESO2p2/WFI instrument covering the sky path of these 10 large TNOs for the
2008-2015. We made the astrometry of 316 GB of images with the Platform for
Reduction of Astronomical Images Automatically (PRAIA). By relatively simple
astrometric techniques, we treated the overlapping observations and derived a
field distortion pattern for the WFI mosaic of CCDs to within 50 mas precision.
The catalog star positions were obtained in the UCAC2 frame with errors of
40 mas for stars up to magnitude completeness (about R = 19). New stellar
proper motions were also determined with 2MASS and the USNO B1.0 catalog
positions as first epoch. The catalogs of all TNOs contain in all more than
5.35 million stars with proper motions, covering the sky paths of the objects
with 30 arcmin width. The magnitude completeness is about R = 19 with a limit
about R = 21. Ephemeris offsets with about 50 mas to 100 mas precision were
applied for each TNO orbit to improve the predictions. They were obtained
during 2007-2010 from a parallel observational campaign carried out with 0.6 m
to 2.2 m size telescopes.

The 2718 candidate stars listed in the prediction tables were searched using a
proximity radius of 335 mas with the geocentric apparent orbit (corrected by
ephemeris offsets) of the body considered. This radius is about the apparent
radius of a body with Pluto's size (50 mas) plus the apparent Earth radius
(285 mas) as projected in the sky plane at 31 AU (about the Pluto-Earth
distance for 2008-2015). No threshold in R magnitude was used in the search for
candidates, as relatively faint R objects may turn out to be bright infrared
stars, perfect targets for the SOFIA observatory and for ground-based
instruments well equipped with H, J or K band detectors (H, J and K magnitudes
are promptly available in the tables if the star belongs to the 2MASS). Besides,
events may be also favored by slow shadow speeds of less than 20 km/s. Also, no
constraint on a geographic place was applied, as in principle SOFIA
observations can be done from any sub-solar point on Earth. Events in daylight
at sub-planet point were not excluded either, as they could yet be observable
in the dark, right above the horizon, from places near the Earth terminator. We
furnish here prediction tables for future and also for past stellar
occultations covering the sky paths between 2008-2015. The importance of
predictions for occultations still to come is obvious. But the predictions of
past occultations are also useful for at least three reasons. First, they can
be used by anyone as reference for ongoing fittings of light curves of recent
past observed events. Second, they serve to derive ephemeris drifts by
comparing expected and observed central instants and C/A values. Finally, they
can be used as an external check for the accuracy and precision of our
prediction tables. 

In all, for R = 19 stars (catalog magnitude completeness) and 40 mas errors
in the WFI positions, we may assume a bulk error of about 80 mas for C/A,
dominated by the ephemeris offsets errors of about 70 mas. For about 40 A.U.,
this implies a shadow path uncertainty over the Earth of the order of 2300 km.
If the ephemeris offsets can be well determined to within 30 mas precision,
then a bulk error of 50 mas in C/A can be achieved, leading to a precision of
about 1400 km for the WFI occultation path predictions. Thus, the probability
of actually observing the occultation is not as high as hoped, but not
despairingly small, especially if the event occurs above a dense, populated
region in terms of astronomers, including amateurs.

Description:
Each prediction table contains the date and instant of stellar occultation
(UTC), the ICRS (J2000) star coordinates  at the event date (that is, corrected
by proper motion), the ICRS (J2000) geocentric right ascension and declination
of the TNO at the occultation, the closest apparent geocentric distance between
star and body, the position angle of the shadow across the Earth (clockwise,
zero at North), the velocity in km/s, the distance to the Earth (AU), longitude
of the sub-solar point, local solar time, ephemerides offsets in (RA, DEC) for
the central instant (see JPL ephemeris version in Table 7 of Assafin et al.
2012), the catalog proper motion, the catalog and multiplicity flags, the
estimated star catalog position errors, the proper motions and the magnitudes
R*, J*, H* and K*. Magnitudes are normalized to a reference shadow velocity v
of 20 km/s (the typical shadow velocity of a body at Pluto's distance at
opposition). Mag_normalized = mag + 2.5 log_10(v/20). These normalized
magnitudes may bring forward faint stars involved in slow events, thus allowing
for longer integration time, and consequently reasonably good signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) without loss of spatial resolution in diameter measurements and in
probing atmosphere altitudes in the light curves. This situation is further
favored as the brightness of TNOs are usually smaller than that of the stars.
In all, the overall contribution to the total recorded flux must be evaluated
and a case by case estimation of the SNR must be done for those candidates.

The prediction tables are divided by body and year, with entries in cronological
order. The reference ephemerides used are listed in Table 7 of Assafin et al.
(2012). Besides star positions, the ICRS (J2000) geocentric right ascension and
declination of the TNO at the occultation are also given (they are corrected by
ephemeris offsets). This makes it easy for the reader to evaluate his/her own
updates on the star positon or on the ephemeris offsets of the TNOs. Notice that
some tables present zero entries. This is not in error and only means that for
some TNOs and years no occultation is foreseen.

Note (1): This is the position angle of the body with respect to the star at
          closest approach; PA is zero when the body is north of the star and
          is counted clockwise
Note (2): This is the occultation shadow velocity across the Earth at the
          apparent geocentric distance of the body; it has a positive/negative
          sign for prograde/retrograde velocities, that is, when the TNO's
          geocentric right ascension is respectively increasing/decreasing 
Note (3): J, H or K magnitudes marked "50.0" mean no infrared magnitudes
          available; this means that it is not a 2MASS star
Note (4): Star has proper motion? If yes, flag = "ok", otherwise flag = "no"
Note (5): flag = "uc" means UCAC2 star; flag = "2m" means 2MASS star; otherwise,
          flag = "fs" means field star (not a UCAC2 or 2MASS catalog star)
Note (6): astrometric multiplicity flags range from 0 to 6:
          flag = 0 : final WFI mosaic star position ok; all contributing
                     individual CCD positions were within 0.2 arcsec from each
                     other after the final WFI mosaic solutions; no nearby
                     individual CCD position was identified within 1.5 arcsec of
                     the final catalog star position, indicating good astrometry
          flag = 1 : a number of individual CCD positions was identified within
                     1.5 arcsec of each other; more than one of these individual
                     positions was labeled as a UCAC2 star; the final catalog
                     position assigned for this star came from the average over
                     these individual CCD positions labeled as UCAC2; the same
                     flag is assigned if it refers to the 2MASS catalog (one
                     can distinguish between both cases looking at the catalog
                     flag)
          flag = 2 : a number of individual CCD positions was identified within
                     1.5 arcsec of each other; but only one single of these
                     positions was labeled UCAC2/2MASS; this single position
                     was assigned as the final catalog star position (the
                     catalog flag indicates which catalog is involved - UCAC2 or
                     2MASS)
          flag = 3 : some contributing individual CCD positions were within 0.2
                     arcsec from each other after the final WFI mosaic
                     solutions, but the resulting positions were nearby others
                     within 1.5 arcsec; none of these positions were labeled
                     UCAC2 or 2MASS; here, the final catalog star position
                     assigned for this star came from the entry with highest
                     number (N not equal to 1) of individual position
                     contributions from the WFI mosaic solution
          flag = 4 : same situation as in flag "3", but more than one entry
                     presented the same highest number of individual position
                     contributions; in this case, the final catalog star
                     position assigned for this star came from the single entry
                     with least (x,y) measured errors
          flag = 5 : same situation as in flag "4", but more than one entry
                     presented the same best (x,y) measurement errors; in this
                     case, the final catalog star position assigned for this
                     star came from the single entry with brightest R magnitude
          flag = 6 : same situation as in flag "5", but more than one entry
                     presented the same brightest R magnitudes; in this case,
                     the final catalog star position assigned for this star came
                     from the average over all detected multiple entries
Note (7): Error values marked "9999" mean no estimated errors; this regards to
          astrometric flagged positions or to positions from one observation
Note (8): proper motion values marked "9999" mean no computed proper motions;
          this is because no first epoch position counterpart could be found in
          the 2MASS or USNO B1.0 catalogs
