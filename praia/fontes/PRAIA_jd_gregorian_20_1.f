*
*  Universal Time to Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (IAU 1982 model).
*
*  This routine is part of the International Astronomical Union's
*  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
*
*  Status:  canonical model.
*
*  Given:
*     DJ1, DJ2     d      UT1 Julian Date (see note)
*
*  The result is the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (radians), in the
*  range 0 to 2pi.
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1  The UT1 epoch DJ1+DJ2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
*     convenient way between the arguments DJ1 and DJ2.  For example,
*     JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
*     among others:
*
*             DJ1            DJ2
*
*         2450123.7D0        0D0        (JD method)
*          2451545D0      -1421.3D0     (J2000 method)
*         2400000.5D0     50123.2D0     (MJD method)
*         2450123.5D0       0.2D0       (date & time method)
*
*     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
*     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
*     is acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
*     between resolution and convenience.  The date & time method is
*     best matched to the algorithm used:  maximum accuracy (or, at
*     least, minimum noise) is delivered when the DJ1 argument is for
*     0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the DJ2 argument lies in the
*     range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
*
*  2  The algorithm is based on the IAU 1982 expression.  This is always
*     described as giving the GMST at 0 hours UT1.  In fact, it gives the
*     difference between the GMST and the UT, the steady 4-minutes-per-day
*     drawing-ahead of ST with respect to UT.  When whole days are ignored,
*     the expression happens to equal the GMST at 0 hours UT1 each day.
*
*  3  In this routine, the entire UT1 (the sum of the two arguments DJ1
*     and DJ2) is used directly as the argument for the standard formula,
*     the constant term of which is adjusted by 12 hours to take account
*     of the noon phasing of Julian Date.  The UT1 is then added, but
*     omitting whole days to conserve accuracy.
