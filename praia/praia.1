.TH PRAIA 1 "September 13, 2013"
.SH NAME
praia \- Platform for Reduction of Astronomical Images Automatically

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B praia
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.B [-e] [-m] [-r] [-s]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBPRAIA\fP performs high precision differential photometry and astrometry on digitized images 
(CCD frames, Schmidt plate surveys, etc). The package main characteristics are automation, 
accuracy and processing speed. Written in FORTRAN 77, it can run in scripts and interact 
with any visualization and analysissoftware. PRAIA is in cope with the ever growing amount 
of observational data available from private and public sources, including data mining and 
next generation fast telescope all sky surveys, like SDSS, Pan-STARRS and others. PRAIA 
was officially assigned as the astrometric supporting tool for participants in the GAIA-FUNSSO 
activities and it's freely available for the astronomical community.
.PP
\fBPRAIA\fP is a shell script that runs a fortran 77 software
and utilises \fBYAD\fP for graphic interface.

.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').

.SS DAT file options
These option must be used after task options
.TP
.B \-e
Run PRAIA task using dat file from directory. It doesn't display any interface.
.TP
.B \-m
Show manual from task required.
.TP
.B \-r
Run PRAIA task using parameters from last running. It doesn't display any interface.
.TP
.B \-s
Show last parameters used. It doesn't display any interface.

.SH EXAMPLES
Display a menu with all PRAIA tasks. It's like opening it by the icon.
.IP
praia
.PP
Display a interface where the user can edit all parameters required by the task "Big Table".
At the end, a dat file will be saved in the directory with the parameters used.
.IP
praia --big-table
.PP
Run PRAIA task named "Astrometry" using parameters of the file "PRAIA_astrometry_1.dat"
.IP
praia --astrometry -e
.PP
Run PRAIA task that extract header information from Fits file using last parameters used.
.IP
praia --hextraction -r
.PP
